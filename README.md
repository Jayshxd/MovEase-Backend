## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a classic N-tier architecture, separating concerns into different layers:

- **Controller Layer:** Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and delegates to the service layer.
- **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic of the application.
- **Repository Layer:** Responsible for data access and communication with the database using Spring Data JPA.
- **Entity Layer:** Defines the data model and database schema.
- **Security Layer:** Manages authentication and authorization using Spring Security and JWT.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The database schema is designed to be normalized and efficient. The main entities and their relationships are as follows:

- `User`: Stores user information and has a many-to-many relationship with `Role`.
- `Role`: Stores user roles (e.g., `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`).
- `Movie`: Contains movie details and has a one-to-many relationship with `Show`.
- `Theatre`: Stores theatre information and has a one-to-many relationship with `Screen`.
- `Screen`: Represents a screen in a theatre and has one-to-many relationships with `Seat` and `Show`.
- `Seat`: Represents a physical seat in a screen.
- `Show`: Represents a specific show of a movie in a screen and has one-to-many relationships with `Booking` and `ShowSeat`.
- `ShowSeat`: Represents the state of a seat for a particular show (e.g., available, booked).
- `Booking`: Stores booking details and has relationships with `User`, `Show`, and `ShowSeat`.

## üöÄ API Endpoints

The application provides a rich set of RESTful APIs. You can explore and test the APIs using the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` after running the application.
